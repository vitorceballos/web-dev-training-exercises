# 07-java-gym-oop

This folder contains a Java object-oriented programming exercise developed as part of the "Programming" module (M03) during my Higher Technical Education in Web Application Development (EQF Level 5).

## Description

This activity models a basic gym management system using object-oriented principles. It includes classes for `Cliente`, `Entrenador`, and `Gimnasio`, allowing the creation and interaction of objects to simulate gym operations. The main program demonstrates how to instantiate these classes and interact with their attributes and methods.

## Features

- Object-oriented programming (OOP) in Java
- Class creation with attributes and constructors
- Encapsulation through getters and setters
- Aggregation of objects (e.g., gym containing trainers and clients)
- Method-based interaction with class instances

## Files

- `Cliente.java`: Defines the client with personal and membership information.
- `Entrenador.java`: Represents a trainer with assigned clients and specialties.
- `Gimnasio.java`: Manages collections of clients and trainers.
- `M03_ACT_07_Gimnasio.java`: Main program demonstrating object interactions.

## Technologies Used

- Java

This exercise reinforced my understanding of OOP concepts in Java, especially class design, object instantiation and method interaction.
