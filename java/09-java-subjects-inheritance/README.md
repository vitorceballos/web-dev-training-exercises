# 09-java-subjects-inheritance

This folder contains a Java inheritance exercise developed as part of the "Programming" module (M03) during my Higher Technical Education in Web Application Development (EQF Level 5).

## Description

This activity simulates a simple educational system using object-oriented programming and inheritance. A general class `Asignatura` is extended by specific subjects such as `Programacion` and `BaseDatos`, each with additional attributes. The main program creates and displays instances of each subject, showcasing inheritance and polymorphism in Java.

## Features

- Use of inheritance in object-oriented design
- Base class (`Asignatura`) with common subject data
- Subclasses (`Programacion`, `BaseDatos`) with extra details
- Method overriding and encapsulation
- Console-based interaction

## Files

- `Asignatura.java`: Base class representing a generic subject.
- `Programacion.java`: Subclass with additional programming-related attributes.
- `BaseDatos.java`: Subclass with database-specific details.
- `M03_ACT_09.java`: Main program that creates and displays subject objects.

## Technologies Used

- Java

This exercise helped me practice object-oriented principles in Java, especially inheritance and subclass specialization in real-world scenarios.
