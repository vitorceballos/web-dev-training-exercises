# 04-java-factorial-and-validation

This folder contains two Java exercises developed as part of the "Programming" module (M03) during my Higher Technical Education in Web Application Development (EQF Level 5).

## Description

These exercises focus on mathematical operations and input validation in Java. The first program calculates the factorial of a given number using a loop. The second one validates whether an entered number is within a specific range and performs conditional checks.

## Features

- Loop-based factorial calculation
- Input validation using conditional statements
- Basic error handling
- Output of results using `System.out.println`

## Files

- `M03_ACT_04_Ejercicio1.java`: Calculates the factorial of an integer entered by the user.
- `M03_ACT_04_Ejercicio2.java`: Validates if the user-entered number is within range and prints custom messages accordingly.

## Technologies Used

- Java

These exercises helped me reinforce the use of loops, mathematical operations and data validation techniques in Java.
