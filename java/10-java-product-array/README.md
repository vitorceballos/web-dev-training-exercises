# 10-java-product-array

This folder contains a Java exercise developed as part of the "Programming" module (M03) during my Higher Technical Education in Web Application Development (EQF Level 5).

## Description

This activity focuses on the creation and manipulation of arrays of objects. It uses a `Producto` class to represent items, storing them in an array and displaying their data through iteration and encapsulated methods.

## Features

- Creation of custom objects
- Use of arrays to manage multiple instances
- Iteration with `for` loops
- Object data access via getter methods
- Console-based output

## Files

- `Producto.java`: Class that defines a product with attributes and access methods.
- `M03_ACT_10.java`: Main program that creates an array of products and displays their data.

## Technologies Used

- Java

This activity reinforced my skills in array manipulation and object-oriented programming in Java.
