# Java Exercises

This folder contains a series of Java exercises completed as part of the "Programming" module (M03) during my Higher Technical Education in Web Application Development (EQF Level 5).

## Description

The activities in this folder cover fundamental and advanced Java programming concepts, including:

- Conditional statements and loops  
- Object-oriented programming (classes, inheritance, polymorphism)  
- Arrays and collections (`ArrayList`, `HashMap`)  
- Exception handling and custom exceptions  
- File I/O operations and object serialization  
- GUI development with Java Swing  
- Database management using JDBC and ObjectDB (JPA)

Each subfolder represents an individual activity and includes the related `.java` files and a `README.md` file explaining the objective, features, and implementation.

## Technologies Used

- Java  
- Java Swing  
- JDBC (MySQL)  
- JPA with ObjectDB

These activities were part of my practical training in Java, helping me strengthen both the fundamentals of programming and real-world software development skills.
