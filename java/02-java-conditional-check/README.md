# 02-java-conditional-check

This folder contains a Java exercise developed as part of the "Programming" module (M03) during my Higher Technical Education in Web Application Development (EQF Level 5).

## Description

This activity focuses on conditional logic using `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements. The program reads a number from the user and determines whether it is positive, negative, or zero, displaying an appropriate message for each case.

## Features

- User input using `Scanner`
- Integer number classification (positive, negative or zero)
- Structured output using conditional blocks

## Files

- `M03_ACT_02.java`: Java program with conditional logic and console interaction.

## Technologies Used

- Java

This activity helped me reinforce basic control structures and user interaction in Java.
