# 06-java-number-counter

This folder contains a Java exercise developed as part of the "Programming" module (M03) during my Higher Technical Education in Web Application Development (EQF Level 5).

## Description

This activity prompts the user to enter a fixed number of integers and then counts how many of them are positive, negative or zero. The program uses arrays and control structures to classify and summarize the input values.

## Features

- Use of arrays to store multiple integers
- Loop structure to process input data
- Conditional logic to classify numbers
- Final summary of counts for positive, negative and zero values

## Files

- `M03_ACT_06.java`: Java program that reads numbers and counts each type.

## Technologies Used

- Java

---

This activity helped me practice array usage, input validation, and conditional processing in Java.
