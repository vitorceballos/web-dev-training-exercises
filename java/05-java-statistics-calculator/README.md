# 05-java-statistics-calculator

This folder contains a modular Java program developed as part of the "Programming" module (M03) during my Higher Technical Education in Web Application Development (EQF Level 5).

## Description

This activity implements a basic statistics calculator that reads a set of numbers and computes statistical values such as minimum, maximum, sum, and average. The program uses an auxiliary class (`EstadisticasUtils`) to separate the logic from the main program and demonstrate modular programming in Java.

## Features

- Modular programming with reusable methods
- Use of arrays to store numerical values
- Calculation of sum, average, minimum, and maximum
- Static utility methods in a separate class
- Clean and structured code organization

## Files

- `CalculadoraEstadisticas.java`: Main class that handles user input and calls the utility methods.
- `EstadisticasUtils.java`: Auxiliary class containing static methods to compute statistics.

## Technologies Used

- Java

This exercise helped me strengthen my understanding of method creation, modular structure, and statistical operations using arrays in Java.
