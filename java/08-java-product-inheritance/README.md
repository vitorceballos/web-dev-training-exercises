# 08-java-product-inheritance

This folder contains an object-oriented Java exercise developed as part of the "Programming" module (M03) during my Higher Technical Education in Web Application Development (EQF Level 5).

## Description

This activity implements a basic product management system using inheritance and polymorphism. The base class `Producto` is extended by the subclasses `Comida`, `Bebida` and `Coccion`, each with their own specific attributes and behaviors. The main program demonstrates how to instantiate and work with these different product types using inheritance.

## Features

- Use of inheritance and polymorphism in Java
- Base class (`Producto`) with common attributes
- Subclasses (`Comida`, `Bebida`, `Coccion`) with extended functionality
- Constructor overloading
- Encapsulation with private attributes and public methods

## Files

- `Producto.java`: Base class with general product information.
- `Comida.java`: Subclass representing food items with expiration and calories.
- `Bebida.java`: Subclass representing drinks with volume and alcohol content.
- `Coccion.java`: Subclass representing cooked items with preparation type.
- `M03_ACT_08.java`: Main program demonstrating inheritance and object interaction.

## Technologies Used

- Java

This activity helped me deepen my understanding of object-oriented programming in Java, especially inheritance, constructors, and class hierarchy.
