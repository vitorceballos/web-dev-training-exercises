# 03-java-even-sum-and-average

This folder contains two Java exercises developed as part of the "Programming" module (M03) during my Higher Technical Education in Web Application Development (EQF Level 5).

## Description

These exercises work with loops, numeric operations, and conditional logic. Both programs deal with processing even numbers within a given range or set, calculating sums and averages.

## Features

- Loop structures (`for`)
- Modulo operation to detect even numbers
- Sum and average calculations
- User input using `Scanner`
- Clean console output

## Files

- `M03_ACT_03_Ejercicio1.java`: Calculates and displays even numbers from 1 to 100 along with their sum.
- `M03_ACT_03_Ejercicio2.java`: Calculates and displays even numbers between two values entered by the user, and computes their average.

## Technologies Used

- Java

These activities helped me practice iteration, numeric processing, and user interaction through Java console applications.
