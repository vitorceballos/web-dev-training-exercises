# User Registration Form

This activity simulates a user registration process using a form that includes JavaScript validation and sends the data to a PHP script for server-side processing.

It was developed as part of the "Client-Side Web Development" module during my Higher Technical Education in Web Application Development (EQF Level 5).

## Description

This activity focuses on input validation, form submission, and integration between front-end and back-end components. It includes:

- A registration form with fields for name, surname, email, and password
- JavaScript-based validation for each input using regular expressions
- Submission of the form to a PHP script that displays the submitted data
- Confirmation message upon successful registration
- Basic layout with clean styling

## Features

- Input validation with custom regular expressions
- Prevention of submission with invalid data
- Integration of HTML, JavaScript, and PHP
- Display of submitted user data on a new page
- Form reset and visual feedback

## Files

- `registro.html`: Main HTML structure with the registration form
- `script.js`: JavaScript validation logic for form fields
- `procesar_registro.php`: PHP script that processes and displays form data
- `registro_exitoso.php`: Confirmation page shown after successful submission
- `styles.css`: CSS file to style the form

## Technologies Used

This activity helped reinforce my understanding of form validation, event handling, and integration with server-side scripts using PHP.
