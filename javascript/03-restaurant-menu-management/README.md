# Restaurant Menu Activity

This activity simulates the management of a restaurant menu using JavaScript objects, classes, and DOM manipulation.

It was developed as part of the "Client-Side Web Development" module during my Higher Technical Education in Web Application Development (EQF Level 5).

## Description

This activity focuses on user-defined structures and dynamic interaction with the DOM using JavaScript. It includes:

- Definition of custom classes (`Plato` and `Menu`)
- Adding, displaying, and removing dishes
- Associating dishes with menus using form inputs and dropdowns
- Updating the interface dynamically through DOM manipulation
- Basic styling with CSS for layout and usability

## Features

- Creation and deletion of individual dishes
- Management of multiple menus and dish associations
- Dynamic rendering of dish lists and menus
- Interaction via forms and select elements

## Files

- `index.html`: Structure of the web interface
- `actividad_restaurante.js`: JavaScript logic with object-oriented structure
- `styles.css`: Styling for the layout, forms, and elements

## Technologies Used

- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript

This activity helped me apply object-oriented concepts and DOM manipulation to create a functional web interface.
