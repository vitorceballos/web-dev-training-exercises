# Student Management System

This project simulates a student management interface that allows adding, navigating, and removing student records dynamically using JavaScript.

It was developed as part of the "Client-Side Web Development" module during my Higher Technical Education in Web Application Development (EQF Level 5).

## Description

This activity focuses on JavaScript DOM manipulation, dynamic list creation, and user interaction through buttons. It includes:

- A form to input student data: name, age, and course
- Addition of students to a visual list
- Navigation through the student entries using "Previous" and "Next" buttons
- Removal of the first student using a delete button
- Visual indication of the selected student

## Features

- Form validation and data handling
- Dynamic creation and deletion of DOM elements
- Navigation system to browse through the list
- Highlighting of the currently selected student

## Files

- `instituto.html`: Main HTML structure with the student form and list container
- `script.js`: JavaScript logic for adding, navigating, and removing students
- `estilos.css`: Styling for layout and student highlighting

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

This exercise was part of my JavaScript training, focused on real-world DOM interaction, logic flow, and interface responsiveness.
