# Gym Reservation Form

This activity simulates a gym reservation system with a dynamic form that stores booking data in cookies and provides validation for user input.

It was developed as part of the "Client-Side Web Development" module during my Higher Technical Education in Web Application Development (EQF Level 5).

## Description

This activity focuses on JavaScript form validation, cookie storage, and event handling. It includes:

- Form for booking gym classes with name, type of class, and date  
- Input validation with regular expressions  
- Storage of booking data in cookies  
- Display of bookings on the page  
- Ability to delete existing bookings from both the DOM and cookies

## Features

- Custom input validation using regular expressions  
- Reservation saving and retrieval using browser cookies  
- Dynamic DOM updates for the list of bookings  
- Button to delete the current booking and clear form  
- Basic alerts for user feedback

## Files

- `gimnasio.html`: Main HTML structure with the reservation form  
- `script.js`: JavaScript logic for validation, DOM interaction, and cookie management  
- `estilos.css`: Styling for the form and layout

## Technologies Used

- HTML

This activity reinforced my knowledge of form management, JavaScript events, and browser storage using cookies.
