# PHP Exercises

This folder contains a series of PHP activities completed as part of the "Web Development in Server Environment" module during my Higher Technical Education in Web Application Development (EQF Level 5).

## Description

The activities in this folder cover key concepts and practices related to server-side development with PHP and MySQL, including:

- Form handling and input validation  
- Session management and authentication  
- File structure separation (MVC-like)  
- Database interaction using SQL  
- Role-based access control  
- Integration with APIs and external services (e.g., Google Maps, SOAP)

Each subfolder represents an individual activity and includes all the necessary files (PHP, SQL, CSS) along with a `README.md` file describing the goal, implementation, and technologies used.

## Technologies Used

- HTML  
- CSS  
- PHP  
- MySQL

These activities were part of my hands-on training in server-side programming, focusing on dynamic web applications, secure data handling, and backend logic using PHP and relational databases.
