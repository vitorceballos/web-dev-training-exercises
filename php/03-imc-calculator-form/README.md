# BMI Calculator Form

This activity simulates a Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator that uses an HTML form to collect user data and processes the result with PHP.

It was developed as part of the "Server-Side Web Development" module during my Higher Technical Education in Web Application Development (EQF Level 5).

## Description

This activity focuses on PHP server-side processing, HTML forms, and modular page structure. It includes:

- A user form with inputs for name, year of birth, weight, and height
- Form submission using the POST method
- BMI calculation and display of result through a PHP script
- Use of header and footer components for consistent layout
- Basic CSS styling for structure and readability

## Features

- Form validation via HTML `required` attributes
- Modular PHP page structure using includes for `header.html` and `footer.html`
- Calculation of BMI and age based on user input
- Display of personalized message with calculated BMI
- Clean visual layout with separation of concerns (HTML/CSS/PHP)
