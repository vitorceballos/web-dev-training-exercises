# 07-map-localization

This activity simulates a location map with selectable categories that dynamically display places from a database on a map.

It was developed as part of the "Web Development in Server Environment" module during my Higher Technical Education in Web Application Development (EQF Level 5).

## Description

This activity focuses on integrating Google Maps with PHP and SQL to dynamically show places based on their category. It includes:

- A database of locations including name, coordinates, city, and type
- HTML interface to select categories such as Restaurant, Bar, or Discoteca
- Google Maps integration to display markers based on selection
- SQL script to create the database and insert sample locations
- Basic CSS styling for layout and form elements

## Features

- Dynamic marker display on map based on category
- Integration with Google Maps JavaScript API
- Locations loaded from MySQL database using PHP
- Clean layout with centered map and form
- Responsive and readable styling with basic HTML and CSS

## Files

- `index.php`: Main page with category selector and map
- `mapa.php`: Backend that fetches locations from the database based on selected type
- `script.sql`: SQL script to create and populate the locations database
- `styles.css`: Stylesheet for layout and design of the interface

## Technologies Used
