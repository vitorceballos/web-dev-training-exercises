It was developed as part of the "Server-Side Web Development" module during my Higher Technical Education in Web Application Development (EQF Level 5).

## Description

This activity consists of several individual PHP scripts that demonstrate fundamental server-side logic. The scripts include:

- Displaying formatted text using variables and strings
- Conditional output based on variable values
- Basic form handling using `$_GET` and `$_POST`
- Separation of logic and presentation through external CSS

## Features

- PHP echo statements and string concatenation
- Conditional logic with `if`, `else`, and `elseif`
- HTML form processing with PHP
- External stylesheet integration

## Files

- `actividad1.1.php`: Displays formatted personal data using PHP variables

- `actividad1.3.php`: Shows student grades and feedback using conditional logic
- `actividad1.4.php`: Simple form for calculating the square of a number (GET method)
- `actividad1.5.php`: Enhanced version using POST and validation
- `style.css`: CSS file for consistent visual styling
